Rubiks Cube with D and OpenGL
=============================

This is done as a school assignment at NTNU, in a course about 3D computer graphics.

## Requirements

- D compiler. I have been using DMD, but they are all pretty compatible
- DUB, the package manager for D
- SDL2 and SDL2-image

Run with `dub run`

I am using the math library [gl3n](https://github.com/Dav1dde/gl3n) which is bundled in my source folder. Should probably have used a git sub module but oh well.
